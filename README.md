## Lessons Learned
  React is pretty awesome. Next project, I will be more mindfull of component structure
so that passing information will be more streamlined regarding paths and reusable functions.
  Although I did not take full advantage, I can see how Styled-Components are very handy for creating reusable styles and themes.   However, my experience with Bootstrap last project was much better in terms of ease of use and final deliverable.

## Stretch Goals Remaining:
* ~Implement search function~
* create many-to-many relationships between stock/account and account/user
* implement a 3rd party api to populate search returns
* (much) Better styling, probably refactor into bootstrap
